🌌 Solar System Simulation

A 3D interactive simulation of the Solar System using **Three.js**, featuring rotating and orbiting celestial bodies, realistic textures, and smooth camera controls. This project demonstrates the use of WebGL through Three.js for educational and visual storytelling.

 🚀 Features

- 🌞 Sun and planets rendered with high-quality textures
- 🌍 Planetary rotation and orbit simulation
- 🌓 Moon orbiting Earth
- 🧭 Interactive camera (OrbitControls)
- 💡 Dynamic lighting from the Sun (PointLight)
- 📁 Modular code structure for scalability
- 🎯 Raycasting for interactive object selection — click on planets to get more info or highlight them.
